In this section, we derive a biologically informed mathematical model to describe and simulate this growth. The goal is to construct a system of differential equations that reflects key dynamics such as natural tumor proliferation, immune response interference, and carrying capacity limitations. We start from biological intuition, translate into word equations, assign variables, and then systematically build up to the final governing equation used in our simulations. Governing Equation of tumor growth \uf0c1 1. Modeling Tumor Growth \uf0c1 In the absence of any external control (e.g., immune system, drugs), tumors generally follow a logistic growth pattern : Growth starts rapidly. slows as space, nutrients, and oxygen become limiting. ...and eventually plateaus at a carrying capacity , denoted K_C . Is this biologically reasonable? Initially, cancer cells divide unchecked. But resource constraints slow down their expansion overtime. Thus, tumor growth eventually halts unless external interventions are applied. Modeling: Rate of change of tumor volume = (intrinsic growth rate) \u00d7 (current tumor size) \u00d7 (resource limitation factor) Translating this: \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\mu \\cdot C \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{C}{K_C} \\right) Where: C(t) : Tumor size at time t \\mu : Intrinsic growth rate of tumor cells K_C : Tumor carrying capacity This is the classical logistic model . 2. ...the Logistic Term, ...there's more \uf0c1 Biological systems often deviate from simple logistic behavior, especially when tumor dynamics are influenced by nonlinear feedback mechanisms. To allow more flexibility in growth curve behavior, we introduce a shape parameter \\alpha , leading to the generalized logistic (Richards) model : \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{K_C} \\right)^\\alpha \\right) So the growth equation becomes: \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\mu \\cdot C \\cdot \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{K_C} \\right)^\\alpha \\right) Now: \\alpha = 1 \u2192 Standard logistic growth \\alpha > 1 \u2192 More abrupt slowdown near capacity \\alpha < 1 \u2192 More gradual saturation See code 3. Lets not forget the immune system \uf0c1 The immune system doesn\u2019t just \u201ckill\u201d cancer cells. It also interferes with their growth indirectly through inflammation, signaling interference, and disruption of angiogenesis. So instead of subtracting a kill term like -pCI , we modulate the growth rate itself. We introduce a new term: 1 + \\psi(I, C) Where: \\psi(I, C) (derived later) is a function describing how the immune cells I affect the growth behavior of the tumor cells. The function can be negative (inhibitory) or positive (stimulatory), allowing for nuanced modeling. This gives us: \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\mu \\cdot (1 + \\psi(I, C)) \\cdot C \\cdot \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{K_C} \\right)^\\alpha \\right) 4. Final Normalization \uf0c1 For mathematical elegance and numerical stability, we normalize the overall equation by \\alpha : \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha} (1 + \\psi(I, C)) C \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{K_C} \\right)^\\alpha \\right) This is our final tumor growth ODE , and it matches exactly with the governing equation in the original project documentation. Final Tumor ODE: \\boxed{ \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha} (1 + \\psi(I, C)) C \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{K_C} \\right)^\\alpha \\right) } Immune Interference Function: \u03c8(I, C) \uf0c1 We define the immune interference function as: \\psi(I, C) = -\\theta \\left( \\frac{I^\\beta}{\\phi C^\\beta + I^\\beta} + \\varepsilon \\log\\_{10}(1 + I) \\right) This function models how the immune system inhibits the growth of tumor cells. Each term in the equation is derived from biological reasoning and mathematical modeling principles. Term-by-Term Breakdown 1. The Scaling Factor: -\\theta \uf0c1 Negative sign : Indicates inhibition of tumor growth. \u03b8 (theta) : Represents the maximum strength of immune-mediated suppression. It scales the entire function, setting a limit on how strong the immune system's effect can be. 2. Suppression Term: \uf0c1 \\frac{I^\\beta}{\\phi C^\\beta + I^\\beta} This component reflects the competitive dynamics between immune cells I and cancer cells C . Numerator I^\\beta : Represents immune \u201cattack power.\u201d The exponent \\beta > 1 introduces nonlinearity, modeling cooperative immune responses. Denominator \\phi C^\\beta + I^\\beta : Models tumor resistance and competition. \\phi C^\\beta : Tumor's ability to resist immune action, scaled by a resistance constant \\phi . This term behaves as saturation function: When I \\gg C , suppression is high. When C \\gg I , suppression drops toward zero. 3. Background Immune Activity Term: \uf0c1 \\varepsilon \\log\\_{10}(1 + I) This term captures low-level immune suppression, even when C is large. The logarithmic form reflects diminishing returns: increasing immune cells beyond a point has less impact. \\varepsilon : A parameter that scales this background immune effect. This term ensures: Some suppression occurs even at low I , But suppression plateaus as I increases \u2014 modeling immune exhaustion or bottlenecks. Von Bertalanffy and Optimal Control Tumor Growth Models \uf0c1 Von Bertalanffy Tumor Growth Model \uf0c1 Starting Assumption: Tumor growth is driven by the surface area of the tumor, while cell death is proportional to its volume. This is biologically reasonable because nutrients and oxygen (which drive proliferation) diffuse in through the surface area, while metabolic waste accumulation and lack of resources cause death throughout the volume. Tumor Volume V(t) Derivation: \uf0c1 Let: V(t) : tumor volume at time t \\frac{dV}{dt} : rate of change of tumor volume Now, using the assumptions: Growth is proportional to surface area : Surface area of a sphere \\propto V^{2/3} So growth term = a V^{2/3} , where a is a growth coefficient. Death is proportional to volume : Death term = b V , where b is a death (or decay) coefficient Differential Equation \\frac{dV}{dt} = aV^{\\frac{2}{3}} - bV This is the Von Bertalanffy equation . Solution to Von Bertalanffy equation \uf0c1 The analytical solution to (1) is derived using integrating factor techniques V(t) = \\left[\\frac{a}{b} + \\left( \\frac{1}{V_0^{1/3}} - \\frac{a}{b} \\right)e^{-\\frac{1}{3}b(t - t_0)}\\right]^3 Where: V_0 : Initial volume at t_0 \\frac{a}{b} : Determines the carrying capacity K K = \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right)^3 : The saturation volume This solution shows: If V_0 < K , tumor grows to equilibrium. If V_0 > K , tumor shrinks to equilibrium. If V_0 = K , tumor remains constant. See code Control Optimization with Cost Functions \uf0c1 So far, we\u2019ve modeled the tumor volume V(t) over time using a differential equation. Now, we want to control it. But not blindly. In the real world, controlling something like a tumor through drug treatment comes at a cost : side effects, resource limits, and drug resistance. So, instead of just minimizing tumor volume blindly, we need a trade-off between effectiveness and consequences. We introduce a control function u(t) , which models the intensity of the treatment (like drug dosage) at time t . Our goal now is to choose u(t) over time in a way that balances: keeping the tumor volume low, and not overusing the drug. This naturally leads to the idea of an optimization problem : we want to find the best u(t) that makes this trade-off optimal. ...let's Start \uf0c1 We model for how the tumor grows and how the drug affects it: Rate of change of tumor volume = (rate of tumor growth \u00d7 current tumor size \u00d7 resource limitation factor) - (magnitude of dose \u00d7 strength of the drug \u00d7 current tumor size) V'(t) = rV(t)(1 - V(t)) - u(t)\\delta(t)V(t) Breakdown of each term: r is the natural growth rate of the tumor cell, \\delta(t) is the magnitude of the dose u(t) captures how effective the drug is at time t ; might decay over time. rV(t)(1 - V(t)) : basic tumor growth using logistic growth (tumor can\u2019t grow forever), u(t)\\delta(t) : reduction in tumor due to drug; higher dosage u(t) , stronger the effect, Initial condition: V(0) = V_0 Control constraint: u(t) \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\in [0, T] Introducing the Objective: What Are We Minimizing? \uf0c1 We now ask: What makes a \u201cgood\u201d treatment strategy? Intuitively, we want to: keep tumor volume low throughout the treatment period, avoid unnecessarily high drug dosages. To express this mathematically, we define a cost function (also called a performance index). This is a single quantity that reflects both goals, so we can minimize it. J(u) = \\int_0^T \\left[ aV(t)^2 + u(t)^2 \\right] dt Explanation: V(t)^2 : penalizes tumor size at each moment\u2014bigger tumor, higher penalty, u(t)^2 : penalizes how much drug we\u2019re using\u2014more drug, more cost, a > 0 : a weighting factor \u2014tells us how much more (or less) we care about tumor size compared to drug usage. This integral adds up the total penalty from time 0 to time T . So, the goal is to find a function u(t) that makes this total cost as small as possible\u2014 without violating the tumor dynamics or the control constraint. The Optimization Problem \uf0c1 Putting everything together: Minimize: J(u) = \\int_0^T \\left[ aV(t)^2 + u(t)^2 \\right] dt Subject to: V'(t) = rV(t)(1 - V(t)) - u(t)\\delta(t), \\quad V(0) = V_0 u(t) \\geq 0 Why This Matters \uf0c1 This formulation sets the stage for powerful mathematical techniques. We're no longer just watching the tumor evolve; we're actively searching for the best way to intervene, balancing outcomes and side effects. The form of the cost function and the constraints reflect real-world priorities: effectiveness vs. safety. Once the problem is written in this way, the next step\u2014if we were to continue\u2014would be to develop necessary conditions for optimality using calculus of variations or tools like Pontryagin's principle. But we stop here, having built a crystal-clear formulation of the problem from scratch.","title":"Derivations"},{"location":"Model/derivation.html#model-derivations","text":"Tumor growth is a complex process governed by the interaction between proliferating cancer cells, the surrounding environment, and the immune system.

Why Cancer? \uf0c1 Worldwide, cancer is a main cause of disease and death. By 2020, doctors found about 19 million newly occurring cancer cases. This number shows the significant influence the sickness has on families, people, and medical systems. Biologically, cancer comes from cells multiplying too rapidly without regard to the body's regular signals, which produces tumors and promotes metastasis. Variations in therapeutic access, socioeconomic status, and public awareness improve this biological complexity and so make cancer a worldwide issue. Cancer has huge social repercussions. Beyond its physical effects, cancer influences mental well-being and society structures. Families find financial trouble from treatment costs; but, patients and caregivers usually carry a significant emotional weight. Dealing with this issue demands a comprehensive strategy that enhances treatment methods in addition to expanding prevention programs. Why Math Modeling? \uf0c1 Mathematical modeling is now absolutely essential for developing reasonable treatment strategies and knowledge of cancer dynamics. Models of biological events enable researchers to grasp the complex interactions of cancer cells, the immune system, and therapy medications. These models enable researchers to project results, theorize, and investigate in ways not feasible with merely experimental methods. In cancer research, mathematical modeling is important for providing a structure for evaluating many scenarios and treatment approaches as well as for basic predictions. In this age, personalized medicine is becoming more and more important; hence, models can assist to adjust treatments to unique patient profiles and indicate which therapies are most likely to be successful. Applications \uf0c1 Among the most fascinating routes of mathematical modeling in cancer research is the investigation of tumor-immune interactions. Tumors can create plans to evade the immune system, a condition that complicates treatment and promotes cancer progression. By modeling these dynamics, researchers might explore the interactions among several immune cell types, assess the efficacy of immunotherapies, and develop strategies to enhance immune responses against cancer. Moreover, using these models helps researchers to duplicate the effects of treatments including customized therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. This approach clarifies which pairs of therapies yield the best outcomes, hence optimizing therapy programs. Key Focus: \uf0c1 ODE-Based Modeling of Tumor Growth, Immune Response, and Chemotherapy Control Cancer modeling makes extensive use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ODE-based modeling allows researchers to numerically depict over time the rates of change in tumor cell and immune cell populations. By constructing systems of differential equations that capture the dynamics of tumor development, the responsiveness of various immune cells, and the impacts of chemotherapy, researchers can study several scenarios. Tumor Growth: ODEs can show the spread of cancer cells considering aspects such as nutrition availability, space, and the tumor microenvironment. Customization of models allows them to display several tumor types and growth patterns. Immune Response: The interaction of cancer cells with the immune system shapes tumor formation and responsiveness to treatment significantly. ODE-based models help one to grasp how malignancies could elude immune recognition by letting one monitor the activation and control of immune cells. Chemotherapy Control: Including the effects of chemotherapy into these models lets scientists duplicate numerous dosage regimes and treatment intensities. This helps to analyze medication efficacy and identify possible resistance mechanisms. All things considered, cancer is a huge medical and social issue harming millions of individuals globally. Mathematical modeling\u2014especially with ODEs\u2014offers a great means to simplify the complexity of tumor-immune interactions and enhance therapeutic strategies. These models help us advance our understanding of cancer and move us closer to overcoming this main challenge in modern medicine, hence improving patient outcomes. Clinical research, mathematics, and biology taken together have significant potential to revolutionize cancer treatment for coming generations.

Tumors can create plans to evade the immune system, a condition that complicates treatment and promotes cancer progression. By modeling these dynamics, researchers might explore the interactions among several immune cell types, assess the efficacy of immunotherapies, and develop strategies to enhance immune responses against cancer. Moreover, using these models helps researchers to duplicate the effects of treatments including customized therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. This approach clarifies which pairs of therapies yield the best outcomes, hence optimizing therapy programs.","title":"Applications"},{"location":"description/introduction.html#key-focus","text":"ODE-Based Modeling of Tumor Growth, Immune Response, and Chemotherapy Control Cancer modeling makes extensive use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ODE-based modeling allows researchers to numerically depict over time the rates of change in tumor cell and immune cell populations. By constructing systems of differential equations that capture the dynamics of tumor development, the responsiveness of various immune cells, and the impacts of chemotherapy, researchers can study several scenarios. Tumor Growth: ODEs can show the spread of cancer cells considering aspects such as nutrition availability, space, and the tumor microenvironment. Customization of models allows them to display several tumor types and growth patterns. Immune Response: The interaction of cancer cells with the immune system shapes tumor formation and responsiveness to treatment significantly. ODE-based models help one to grasp how malignancies could elude immune recognition by letting one monitor the activation and control of immune cells. Chemotherapy Control: Including the effects of chemotherapy into these models lets scientists duplicate numerous dosage regimes and treatment intensities. This helps to analyze medication efficacy and identify possible resistance mechanisms. All things considered, cancer is a huge medical and social issue harming millions of individuals globally. Mathematical modeling\u2014especially with ODEs\u2014offers a great means to simplify the complexity of tumor-immune interactions and enhance therapeutic strategies. These models help us advance our understanding of cancer and move us closer to overcoming this main challenge in modern medicine, hence improving patient outcomes. Clinical research, mathematics, and biology taken together have significant potential to revolutionize cancer treatment for coming generations.","title":"Key Focus:"},{"location":"description/introduction.html#references","text":"","title":"References:"},{"location":"description/modifications.html","text":"Modifications to Models \uf0c1 What This Page Is About \uf0c1 As young students of Ashesi University, our lives intersect with many of the real-world factors that influence disease progression \u2014 and cancer is no exception.

A condensed summary of these basic dynamics is provided below, with an emphasis on tumor formation, immune responses, and the critical links that guide treatment decisions. 1. What Are Tumors? \uf0c1 Uncontrolled cell divisions produce abnormal clumps of tissue called tumors. They can be benign (non-spreading) or malignant (capable of invading tissues and metastasizing). Tumor growth occurs when cell cycle regulation fails\u2014like when checkpoint mechanisms or programmed cell death pathways are disrupted. Genetic mutations often allow cancer cells to override these systems, grow rapidly, and form tumors. 2. What Does the Immune System Do? \uf0c1 The immune system fights off viruses and abnormal cells\u2014including cancer cells. T-lymphocytes (T-cells) detect and destroy tumor cells. Macrophages, which consume pathogens and waste, also coordinate immune signaling. As tumors grow, they emit signals that attract immune cells, sparking a defensive response. But whether the immune system succeeds depends on the tumor\u2019s tactics and the immune response's strength. 3. How Do Tumors Evade Immunity? \uf0c1 Immune surveillance is the body\u2019s constant scanning for abnormal cells. T-cells often kill these cells early. But some cancer cells escape detection using clever tactics\u2014like suppressing immune responses or changing surface proteins. These evasive strategies make cancer harder to treat and highlight the importance of therapies that boost immune recognition. 4. What Populations Matter in our Modeling? \uf0c1 To simulate tumor-immune dynamics, three main populations are modeled: Tumor Cells : Fast-growing, mutation-prone, often resistant. Immune Cells : T-cells attack; macrophages aid and signal. Drug Concentration : Treatments like chemo or immunotherapy affect both tumor and immune responses depending on dosage and timing. 5. What\u2019s the Takeaway? \uf0c1 The relationship between tumor development and immune response is deeply interconnected. Understanding how tumors grow, evade detection, and respond to treatments allows researchers to design better therapeutic strategies. Mathematical modeling turns this knowledge into predictive tools, driving progress in personalized, effective cancer therapies. Every insight helps us edge closer to transformative cancer care.","title":"Tumor Dynamics"},{"location":"description/tumor_g_ine.html#tumor-dynamics","text":"Advancement in cancer treatments depends on knowledge of how tumors develop and interact with the immune system.
